Run fifo_create first
Use a3sdn, and follow the prompts for proper usage.
a3sdn can be ran as a switch or controller, and thus a single
controller can be made, but up to 7 switches can be used.
The various running tasks (switches and controllers) can communicate
to each other with sockets and fifo's.
