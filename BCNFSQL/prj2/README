	- creating new tables for each decomposed FD

3. equivalence.py
- Supporting module
- Used by project2.py
- Responsible for testing the equivalence of 2 sets of FDs in the InputRelationSchema table, and reporting if they are functionally equivalent

4. attributeClosure.py
- Supporting module
- Used by project2.py
- Responsible for the attribute closure functionality

Notes
---------
- These modules assume that the user is using python3 when running the scripts
- Call the project2.py module directly
- Assumed that the database the user enters is in the same directory as project2.py, and that all modules are in same directory
